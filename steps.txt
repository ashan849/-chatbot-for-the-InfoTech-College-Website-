InfortechGPT Chatbot - User Guide (Jupyter Notebook / Anaconda)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This guide explains how to set up and run the InfortechGPT RAG-based PDF chatbot
using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Anaconda installed with Python 3.10 or higher.
2. A folder named "docs" containing your PDF files.
3. Internet connection (to download language models if not cached).

Step 1: Open Anaconda
---------------------
1. Launch the Anaconda Navigator.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator.
3. Navigate to the folder where the chatbot files are stored.

Step 2: Prepare PDF Documents
-----------------------------
1. Create a folder named "docs" in the same directory as the notebook.
2. Place all PDF files you want the chatbot to read into the "docs" folder.
   Example folder structure:
   project_folder/
   ├─ InfortechGPT_notebook.ipynb
   ├─ docs/
      ├─ file1.pdf
      ├─ file2.pdf

Step 3: Install Required Packages
---------------------------------
In a new Jupyter cell, run:

!pip install langchain langchain-huggingface langchain-ollama langchain-chroma sentence-transformers chromadb

Step 4: Load and Run the Chatbot
--------------------------------
1. Open the notebook file (`InfortechGPT_notebook.ipynb`) in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom:
   - The notebook will load the PDFs from the "docs" folder.
   - It will build or load the Chroma vectorstore.
   - The chatbot GUI will open as a tkinter window.

Step 5: Ask Questions
---------------------
1. Type your question in the input box at the top of the GUI window.
2. Click the "Ask" button.
3. The chatbot will display answers retrieved from your PDFs.

Step 6: How the Vectorstore Works
---------------------------------
1. When run for the first time, all PDFs are split into 1000-character chunks.
2. Embeddings are created for each chunk and stored in a local Chroma vectorstore ("chroma_db").
3. Subsequent runs use the existing vectorstore for faster responses.

Step 7: Updating PDFs
---------------------
1. Add new PDF files to the "docs" folder.
2. Delete the existing "chroma_db" folder (optional but recommended).
3. Re-run the notebook to rebuild the vectorstore with the new PDFs.

Step 8: Tips for Users
----------------------
- Keep PDF file names simple and avoid special characters.
- Ask clear and specific questions for better answers.
- Ensure sufficient RAM if using many PDFs.

Troubleshooting:
----------------
1. "ModuleNotFoundError": Make sure required packages are installed.
2. "No PDFs found": Verify the "docs" folder exists and contains PDFs.
3. Slow responses: The first run may take longer to create embeddings; subsequent runs are faster.
